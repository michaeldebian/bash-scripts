-rwxr-xr-x 1 debmadm dmgrp 500 Feb 6 2013 welcome.html
-rwxr-xr-x 1 debmadm dmgrp 16872 Jul 8 2014 runInstaller
drwxr-xr-x 14 debmadm dmgrp 31 Dec 26 11:49 stage
drwxr-xr-x 4 debmadm dmgrp 14 Dec 26 11:49 install
drwxr-xr-x 2 debmadm dmgrp 4 Dec 26 16:05 response
3. Update the response file.

a sample response file comes with the software itself. We just need the update the response file with required values.


Ezoic
RESPONSE FILE LOCATION – > $SOFTWARE/client/response/client_install.rsp

In the response file, we will update only the below values.

NOTE – Here we have selected installation type as Administrator

INVENTORY_LOCATION=/dmapps/product/oraInventory
SELECTED_LANGUAGES=en
ORACLE_HOME=/dmapps/product/release/oracle/oracle/product/12.1.0/client_1
ORACLE_BASE=/dmapps/product/release
oracle.install.client.installType=Administrator

The response file will look like this – >  client_install

If you wish you to customize the installation, then you can go through the response file and update accordingly.

4. Now do the installation silently.

./runInstaller -ignoreSysPrereqs -showProgress -silent -responseFile /software/client/response/client_install.rsp
